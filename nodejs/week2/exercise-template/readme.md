### Movies

We will be making an api for getting movies ðŸŽžðŸ“½ðŸŽ¥ðŸŽ¦ðŸŽ¬

Using this template you are in [here](./). Remember to clone it locally, open a terminal in the folder and run `npm install`. Now how can you start the server??

Try and begin by getting an overview of the project. What file is called when the server is started. What routes is that setting up and so on

Check the [movies router file](./src/backend/api/movies-router.js). This is where you will be creating your routes. The `movies/` route has even been created for you (now you just need to return the movies). Pass back all the values from the endpoints in a JSON object with a key of `data` and then the information to be passed back. An example would be like:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {"title": "'71","year": 2014,"rating": 7.2,"votes": 41702,"running_times": 5940}
    ]
}
```

If returning a single item, do not return the information in an array, but an object instead:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "title": "'71",
        "year": 2014,
        "rating": 7.2,
        "votes": 41702,
        "running_times": 5940
    }
}
```

|Route|Requirement|
|---|---|
| `/api/movies/` | Return all movies |
| `/api/movies/<id>` | Return a single movie with that matching ID  |
| `/api/movies?beginYear=<year1>&endYear=<year2>` | Returns all movies with year between `beginYear` and `endYear`  |
| `/api/movies?beginYear=<year1>&endYear=<year2>&minRating=<minRating>` | Returns all movies with year between `beginYear` and `endYear` that are also of rating `minRating` or better |

Finally do some error handling for cases where `beginYear`, `endYear` or `minRating` are not specified

### Is chrome browser middleware

Create a middleware function that creates a key on the `request` object called `isChromeBrowser`. If the browser accessing the website is a chrome browser it should be assigned to `true`, otherwise `false`.

You can add this middleware to the [app.js](./exercise-template/src/backend/app.js)

Remember to test that the middleware works!
